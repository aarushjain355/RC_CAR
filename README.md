# RC Car

A remote controlled car that was built with an ESP866 micro controller. The car used the Websocket library to communicate with the web interface in the Arduino Ide and was powered by a 12 V battery pack. The actuation included a dc motor and a servo motor where the dc motor was powered by a DRV8333 motor controller. The dc motor controlled the 3 back wheels and translated it back and forth whereas the servo motor handled the steering of the car and would control the front two wheels to steer based on the signals sent from the user's remote control
